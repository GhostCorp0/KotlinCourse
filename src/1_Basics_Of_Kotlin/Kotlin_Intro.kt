/**
 *  Kotlin is created by jet brain in 2010 - 11 and first version released in 2016.
 *  Kotlin compiles to JVM bytecode -> Run on java virtual machine (JVM) like java.
 *  Kotlin code is converted to Java bytecode -> Executed by the JVM.
 *
 *  Why JetBrains created Kotlin?
 *
 *  Jetbrains needed a modern language that:
 *  was interpreted with java:
 *
 *  Had better syntax (less boilerplate code).
 *
 *  Was type-safe(avoiding NullPointerExceptions).
 *  Had first class support for functional programming.
 *
 *  Since existing languages like Scala,Groovy and Clojure had issues like (slow compilation,complexity),
 *  Jetbrains decided to create their own language.
 *
 *  Why did Google chooses Kotlin as the official language? (accepted official language in 2017)
 *
 *  Ans -> Java had limitations -> Kotlin solved them with better syntax and safety.
 *  Kotlin was 100% interoperable with Java -> No need to rewrite code.
 *  Jetbrains actively supports kotlin -> Frequent updates and improvements.
 *  Kotlin had massive developer demand -> Many android developers prefers kotlin over java.
 *  Google wanted a modern, efficient language -> Kotlin has better performance and fewer crashes.
 *
 *  How popular it is right now in its scope ->
 *
 *  Kotlin is already used by over 60% of professional Android Developers,
 *  dn 95 % of the top 1000 Android apps contain Kotlin code.
